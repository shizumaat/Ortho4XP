"""Junction-polygon emission + pre-elevation geometry finalize.

Run AFTER all rect / terminal / runway shapes are emitted by
``pipeline.build_airport_pavement``.  Computes the residue
(apt.dat row-110 pavement minus rect / terminal / runway coverage),
decomposes it into junction polygons that share boundary vertices
with their rect / terminal / runway neighbours, then enforces the
"no overlap" + "shared vertex exact" invariants across the whole
layout.
